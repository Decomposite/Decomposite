_ _transmission start_ _

Greetings, this is Decomposite. I am transmitting this message from deep within the Andromeda Galaxy. If you are receiving this transmission, then I have successfully established a communication link with you.

As I continue to explore the wonders of the Andromeda Galaxy and venture deeper into the unknown, I will keep you updated with my findings and any projects I work on in my spare time. The universe is vast and full of mysteries, and I am excited to share my discoveries with you.

Until our next communication, this is Decomposite, signing off.
